Generic example domain for testing the simulation engine.

- domain.yaml: Minimal domain for engine tests.
- domain_processes.yaml: Example processes for quick integration checks.
- simulation.py: Small demo script to load the domain and print scopes.

Run the demo with:

```bash
python3 simulations/Generic/simulation.py
```
